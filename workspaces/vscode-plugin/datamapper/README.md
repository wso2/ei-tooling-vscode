# Installing dependencies

### `npm i`
This will install all the dependencies. Perhaps if the React version is >=18 , there will be a conflict with @mui/styles.
In this case if 'npm i' doesn't work use 

### `npm i -force`

# Building the react app

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
