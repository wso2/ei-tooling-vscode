# Installing dependencies

### `npm i`

This will install all the dependencies. Perhaps if the React version is >=18 , there will be a conflict with @mui/styles.
In this case if 'npm i' doesn't work use

### `npm i -force`

# Building the react app

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

# Node
